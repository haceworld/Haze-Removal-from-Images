# Haze-Removal-from-Images
Haze Removal can remove slight to extreme cases of haze affecting an image. Its most typical use is for landscape photography where the haze causes low contrast and low saturation, but it can also be used to improve images taken during rainy and foggy conditions.

This code cotains the implementation of single and multiple dehazing processing of image(s). 
Note: Remember to modify the path to your directory folder.
